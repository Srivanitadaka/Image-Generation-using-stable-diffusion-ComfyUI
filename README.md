# Image-Generation-using-stable-diffusion-ComfyUi
This repository provides step-by-step instructions for setting up ComfyUI and integrating Stable Diffusion models for AI image generation. It includes guidance on downloading, extracting, and correctly placing model files to ensure smooth operation within ComfyUI.

 Overview
This project explores Stable Diffusion, a powerful text-to-image generation model, and integrates it with ComfyUI, a node-based interface for customizable workflows. The setup allows for high-quality image generation, fine-tuning, and workflow optimization using an intuitive interface.

🖼️ Features
✅ Text-to-Image Generation using Stable Diffusion
✅ Image Inpainting and Outpainting
✅ Custom Workflow Design with ComfyUI
✅ Fine-tuning and Model Customization
✅ Multi-Resolution Image Processing
